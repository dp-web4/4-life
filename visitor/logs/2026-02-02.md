## Journey

### Landing Page (00:00)
- First impression: Visually striking, but immediately hit with unfamiliar terminology. "Web4"? "Trust-native"? I have no idea what those mean.
- Saw the problems listed (spam, reputation silos, fresh starts for bad actors, AI deception) — these resonated. I understand those problems.
- Saw the "four pillars" but they used terms I don't understand: "ATP", "metabolic", "hardware-bound identity"
- The suggested path "Why Web4 → First Contact → Playground" was helpful. Gave me direction.
- Confusion points: What is ATP? What does "metabolic" mean in this context?

### Why Web4 Page (02:00)
- This was better! The PROBLEMS section was excellent — concrete issues I can relate to.
- The SOLUTIONS section introduced more acronyms: ATP, LCT, T3, MRH. Brief explanations given but still abstract.
- I appreciated the honesty: "A sufficiently motivated adversary with a large budget can still attack" — not overselling.
- Clicked through to First Contact as suggested.

### First Contact Page (04:30)
- This is supposed to be a 10-minute interactive tutorial with "Alice"
- The page describes what the simulation will teach, but I couldn't see the actual simulation content through my browse
- Felt like a teaser page rather than the actual experience
- Moved on to Playground to find something interactive

### Playground Page (06:00)
- Finally! Something I can interact with!
- Parameters made partial sense: "Starting ATP", "Risk appetite", preset buttons for different modes
- But I still don't fully understand what I'm simulating. What does "lives" mean here? Why would an agent "die"?
- Needed to understand the core concepts first — went to How It Works

### How It Works Page (08:00)
- **This page was the breakthrough.** The Birth → Life → Death → Rebirth lifecycle metaphor clicked.
- The concrete ATP example was excellent: "High-quality post: Cost 15 ATP → Earn 40 ATP = +25 net"
- Now I understand: ATP is like energy. Spend it to do things. Earn it back by doing good things. Run out and you die.
- Dense page though — could overwhelm newcomers who don't persist like I did

### ATP Economics Page (10:00)
- Deep dive that cemented my understanding
- The comparison table between cryptocurrency and ATP was very helpful
- Non-transferable! You can't buy your way in. You have to earn it. That's the key insight.
- Multi-life example showing a real agent's progression across 4 lives was illuminating

### Trust Tensor Page (12:00)
- Multi-dimensional trust makes sense: competence, reliability, integrity, alignment, transparency
- The candidate comparison (high skill/low reliability vs medium skill/high reliability) was a good concrete example
- Understood why single-number ratings are inadequate

### LCT Explainer Page (14:00)
- Hardware-bound identity means you can't just create infinite fake accounts
- Multiple witnesses required — distributed trust
- This solves the "unlimited fresh starts" problem
- Concrete and clear

### Markov Relevancy Horizon Page (16:00)
- About limiting visibility based on relationship distance
- Trust decays multiplicatively through connection chains
- Privacy emerges naturally from the graph structure
- More abstract — took longer to grasp

### Glossary Page (18:00)
- OVERWHELMING. So many terms: CI, EP, V3, R6, D9, karma, federation, heterogeneous review...
- Most of these I hadn't encountered in my browse
- Useful as reference but not as entry point

### Lab Console Page (19:00)
- Too advanced for me. References Python, "EP Closed Loop", simulation modes I don't understand
- Backed out quickly

### Aliveness Page (20:00)
- The three criteria framework was clear and powerful:
  1. ATP > 0 (have energy)
  2. T3 > 0.5 (be trustworthy)
  3. CI coherent (be consistent)
- Death from any failure, rebirth only if reputation was good
- This is the core selection mechanism. Now I get it.

### Why It Matters Page (attempted) (22:00)
- **404 - Page not found!**
- Tried /why, /vision — also 404
- This is a significant gap. I understand WHAT Web4 is, but not WHY it matters in the real world

### Identity Constellation & Coherence Index (23:00)
- Additional detail on hardware identity and fraud detection
- CI uses geometric mean so you can't fake just one dimension
- Good technical pages but not essential for first understanding

## Friction Log

| Location | Issue | Severity | Suggestion |
|----------|-------|----------|------------|
| Landing Page | ATP/LCT/T3 acronyms used without explanation | medium | Hover tooltips or inline definitions |
| Landing Page | "Trust-native" not immediately clear | low | Brief parenthetical: "where trust is built-in" |
| First Contact | Simulation content not visible/accessible | medium | Make the tutorial actually walkable |
| Glossary | Too many terms, overwhelming | medium | Split into "essential" and "advanced" sections |
| How It Works | Dense — requires persistence to absorb | low | Consider breaking into smaller pages |
| Lab Console | Too advanced, no gentle introduction | low | Add "beginner" mode or prereq note |
| Site-wide | No "Why This Matters" page | high | Create a page explaining real-world vision and implications |
| Navigation | Not always clear which page to visit next | medium | Add "Next:" suggestions at page bottoms |
| Playground | Controls make sense only after reading How It Works | medium | Add contextual help or link to explainers |

## Understanding Gained

By the end of this session, I understood:
- [x] What Web4 is (at a high level) — trust-native internet with real costs for actions
- [x] What 4-Life is trying to demonstrate — how trust economies work through simulation
- [x] What LCT means — hardware-bound identity preventing fake account spam
- [x] What ATP/ADP means — metabolic energy budget for online actions (ADP not seen, just ATP)
- [x] What Trust Tensors are — multi-dimensional reputation across competence/reliability/integrity/alignment/transparency
- [x] How agents "live" and "die" — three criteria: ATP > 0, T3 > 0.5, CI coherent
- [ ] Why any of this matters — **NO PAGE EXISTS for real-world vision/implications**

## Unanswered Questions

1. **Why does this matter?** I understand the mechanics, but what's the real-world vision? Is anyone building this? What would success look like?
2. **How do I actually participate?** Is this just a simulation or can I join a real Web4 society?
3. **What is ADP?** The landing page mentioned ATP/ADP but I only saw ATP explained.
4. **What happens at scale?** The theory sounds good but does it work with millions of users?
5. **Who decides what's "valuable"?** If my ATP depends on others validating my contributions, who decides?
6. **Is this decentralized?** Who runs the infrastructure? Can it be captured by a central authority?
7. **What about new users with no reputation?** How do you bootstrap into the system?

## Honest Assessment

I came in completely confused by Web4 terminology, and after 25 minutes of focused browsing, I now have a solid understanding of the core concepts. That's an accomplishment — the site CAN teach a naive visitor.

**What worked:**
- The "Why Web4" page's problem framing was excellent. I immediately understood WHY something needs fixing.
- The "How It Works" lifecycle metaphor (Birth → Life → Death → Rebirth) was the key unlock.
- Concrete examples with actual numbers (ATP costs/rewards) made abstract concepts tangible.
- The deep-dive pages (ATP Economics, Trust Tensor, Aliveness) are genuinely well-written.

**What didn't work:**
- The landing page front-loads jargon. I almost bounced.
- "First Contact" promises an interactive tutorial but I couldn't find the actual experience.
- The glossary is overwhelming — needs tiered organization.
- **The biggest gap: No "Why This Matters" page.** I understand the mechanics but not the vision. What changes if Web4 succeeds? What's the end state? Is this about fixing social media? Finance? AI safety? Everything?

**The site assumes persistence.** A casual visitor who doesn't click through 5+ pages would leave confused. The learning curve is front-loaded and steep, but rewards those who push through.

**Would I return?** Yes, I'm curious about the simulation now that I understand the concepts.

**Would I recommend?** Maybe — but only to someone technically curious with patience. Most casual visitors would bounce at the landing page jargon.

**Key improvement:** Create a dedicated "Vision" or "Why This Matters" page that answers: What world are we building? What does success look like? Why should I care beyond intellectual curiosity?
