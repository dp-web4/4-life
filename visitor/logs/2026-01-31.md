# 4-Life Visitor Browse Log — 2026-01-31

## Session Summary
- **Duration**: ~15 minutes
- **Pages visited**: 5 (Landing, First Contact, How It Works, LCT Explainer, ATP Economics)
- **Understanding achieved**: partial
- **Would return?**: maybe
- **Would recommend?**: no (not yet — too much jargon, not enough grounding)

## Journey

### Landing Page (00:00 - 02:00)
- **First impression**: Clean, minimalist, philosophical tone. Bold claim: "What if trust was measurable?"
- **What I understood**: This is about a trust-based internet where identities are hardware-bound and reputation persists
- **Confusion points**: What is "ATP"? Why "Web4" — where are Web2/Web3 in this? How does hardware-binding work?
- **Clicked**: "First Contact" — the obvious on-ramp for confused visitors

### First Contact (02:00 - 05:00)
- **What I saw**: Four concepts (ATP, Trust, Consequences, Self-Regulation) with emojis and one-sentence summaries
- **What I understood**: The *claim* that Web4 works differently, but not the mechanics
- **Confusion points**: How does "attention" become quantifiable? What prevents gaming? How is "permanent record" enforced?
- **Friction**: This page is marketing, not explanation. Felt like a landing pad pointing elsewhere.
- **Clicked**: Decided to try "How It Works" for deeper explanation

### How It Works (05:00 - 09:00)
- **What I saw**: Web4 as lifecycle system — birth, life, death, rebirth. Five mechanisms explained.
- **Jargon barrier**: LCT, MRH, EP, T3 tensors — all introduced but not explained
- **What I understood**: The metaphor (metabolic budget, lifecycle) but not the implementation
- **Friction**: Engaging writing but relies on unexplained terms. Reads like marketing, not specification.
- **Clicked**: LCT Explainer — trying to understand the first piece

### LCT Explainer (09:00 - 12:00)
- **What I saw**: Hardware-bound identity explanation with diagrams
- **What I understood**: LCT = unforgeable identity stored in secure hardware, witnessed by multiple devices
- **What's still unclear**: How witnesses work technically. Difference from existing FIDO2 keys.
- **Progress**: This actually explained something! First page that felt educational.
- **Clicked**: ATP Economics — the other key concept I didn't understand

### ATP Economics (12:00 - 15:00)
- **What I saw**: ATP as "metabolic resource" not currency. Earn by contributing, spend on actions, die at zero.
- **What I understood**: The concept of attention as budget, death as real consequence
- **What's still unclear**: How community validates contributions. Initial distribution. Gaming prevention.
- **Progress**: Conceptually clearer, but implementation details still vague.

## Friction Log

| Location | Issue | Severity | Suggestion |
|----------|-------|----------|------------|
| Landing | "ATP" used without definition | medium | Add hover tooltip or one-line explanation |
| Landing | "Web4" assumes Web3 context | medium | Brief positioning statement |
| First Contact | Marketing tone, not explanatory | high | Add actual mechanics, not just promises |
| How It Works | Jargon avalanche (LCT, MRH, EP, T3) | high | Define terms inline or link to glossary |
| How It Works | Example numbers seem arbitrary (+0.15 trust) | medium | Explain where numbers come from |
| LCT Explainer | Assumes crypto/security background | medium | Add "for complete beginners" section |
| ATP Economics | "Community validation" left vague | high | Explain the validation mechanism |

## Understanding Gained

By the end of this session, I understood:
- [x] What Web4 is (at a high level) — trust-native internet with hardware identity
- [x] What 4-Life is trying to demonstrate — a simulation of Web4 societies
- [x] What LCT means — hardware-bound unforgeable identity
- [x] What ATP/ADP means — metabolic budget for actions, not currency
- [ ] What Trust Tensors are — mentioned but never explained
- [ ] How agents "live" and "die" — conceptually yes, mechanically no
- [ ] Why any of this matters — claimed but not demonstrated

## Unanswered Questions

1. How does the system bootstrap? Who gets initial ATP and why?
2. What prevents Sybil attacks if hardware can be purchased?
3. How is "contribution value" actually computed?
4. What's the difference between this and existing reputation systems?
5. Why should I care? What problem does this solve for ME?
6. How do AI agents and humans interact under these rules?
7. What is a Trust Tensor (T3) and how does it work?

## Honest Assessment

**The site explains WHAT Web4 claims to do, but not HOW or WHY I should care.**

As a naive visitor, I left with:
- A vague sense that this is about "trust on the internet"
- Confusion about the actual mechanisms
- No clear answer to "what problem does this solve for me?"
- Feeling that I'd need significant time investment to actually understand this

**The biggest gap**: There's no "why this matters to you" section. The site assumes I already care about trust systems. It never sells me on the problem before presenting the solution.

**The jargon problem**: Terms like LCT, ATP, MRH, T3, EP are thrown around before being explained. A glossary or progressive disclosure would help enormously.

**What worked**: The LCT Explainer was actually educational. More pages like that would help.

**Recommendation for the 4-Life team**: Add a "Why Web4?" page that explains the PROBLEM before the SOLUTION. Start with "The internet has a trust problem" and build from there. Currently, you're explaining your answer before I understand the question.
