## Journey

### Landing Page (00:00)
- First impression: Clean, bold headline "4-Life: Trust-Native Societies." Immediately intriguing but also immediately jargon-heavy. "Trust-Native" — what does that mean? I've never heard that phrase before.
- The problem statement "The Internet Has a Trust Problem" resonated — spam, fake accounts, AI deception. These are real problems I recognize.
- The four pillars (Hardware-bound Identity, Metabolic Attention, Permanent Consequences, AI+Human Coexistence) gave me a high-level sense of direction, but each one introduced new vocabulary without enough context. "Metabolic Attention"? "Trust Tensors"?
- The learning path (Why Web4 → First Contact → Playground) was helpful — it gave me a clear next click.
- Clicked: "Why Web4?" as suggested by the learning path.
- Confusion points: What does "trust-native" actually mean in practice? The four pillars are stated as facts but I don't yet understand WHY or HOW.

### Why Web4? (02:00)
- This page was genuinely good. It starts with problems I recognize (spam, siloed reputation, consequence-free resets, AI deception, centralized control). The problem framing made me care.
- The "Why Previous Solutions Failed" section was effective — I could see that moderation, CAPTCHAs, Web3 wallets, and social login all have real weaknesses.
- The five requirements for "what would actually work" were clear and logical.
- Then it introduces the four mechanisms: ATP, LCT, T3, MRH. This is where I started to lose the thread. Four new acronyms in rapid succession. I could tell what they were *supposed* to do, but the abbreviations are alienating.
- The "Honest Questions" section was surprisingly reassuring. Acknowledging that witness network bootstrapping is "genuinely difficult unsolved research" and that deployment is "currently theoretical" builds credibility rather than undermining it.
- Clicked: "Start First Contact" button to continue the learning path.
- Confusion points: The acronym density is high. ATP, LCT, T3, MRH — by the time I reach the fourth one, I've already half-forgotten what the first one stood for.

### First Contact (06:00)
- This is framed as a 10-minute tutorial. Good — I was expecting a guided experience.
- The "What You'll Learn" section uses emoji icons and plain descriptions. Easier to read than the Why Web4 acronym dump.
- The four-step walkthrough promises: watch Alice, read narrative, understand mechanics, explore resources. Sounds structured.
- **Critical issue**: I clicked "Start Simulation →" and... nothing happened. The button appears to not have a working link (href). This is the most prominent call-to-action on the page, positioned as the natural next step in the learning path, and it's broken.
- I was stuck. The entire learning path funnels to this button and it leads nowhere.
- The page does link to "Why Web4?", "Learning Journey" (/learn), and "How It Works" (/how-it-works) in the related concepts section. But these are secondary — the primary CTA is dead.
- Clicked: Tried the simulation button (broken), then went to Learning Journey instead.
- Confusion points: Where is the simulation? Is it not built yet? There's no error message or "coming soon" indicator — it just silently fails.

### Learning Journey /learn (09:00)
- A structured learning path with 16 concepts across four tiers (Beginner through Practitioner). The progress tracker (0/16 completed) is nice but non-functional for a web visitor — it doesn't seem to persist.
- The beginner path lists five core concepts with reading times. Helpful for scoping commitment.
- The concept descriptions here are clearer than on the landing page. "In Web4, 'alive' isn't metaphorical" is a powerful hook.
- The learning philosophy section (concrete before abstract, problem before solution) matches what I've seen so far — Why Web4 does follow this pattern.
- Clicked: Went to explore the Playground (step 3 of landing page path).
- Confusion points: The progress tracker seems purely visual — can I actually check things off? Does it save? It showed 0% but didn't seem interactive.

### Playground (12:00)
- This is immediately engaging. Sliders for simulation parameters, preset buttons (Easy Mode, Hard Mode, Risk-Averse, Risk-Seeking), and a "Run Simulation" button.
- The introduction clearly explains what I can do: adjust parameters, run simulations, see results, iterate.
- I appreciated the preset buttons — they lower the barrier to entry. I don't know what "Number of Lives: 3" or "Ticks per Life: 15" mean yet, but I can try presets.
- The "Key Insights" section explains Metabolic Balance, Trust Accumulation, Karma Compression, Risk vs Reward. These connect to concepts I've been reading about.
- **Issue**: Can't tell if the simulation actually runs in the browser or requires local setup. The page says "No code, no setup" but I can't verify the output.
- Clicked: Went to Society Simulator.
- Confusion points: What is a "tick"? What does "Risk Appetite: 0.50" actually control? The parameters are presented without enough context for a newcomer.

### Society Simulator (15:00)
- This page immediately captured my interest. "Watch a society of agents with different strategies form trust networks, build coalitions, and self-organize."
- The scenario selector (Cooperative Majority, Hostile World, Reciprocity Rules, etc.) is intuitive — I can pick a world and see what happens.
- The five agent strategies (Cooperator, Defector, Reciprocator, Cautious, Adaptive) are explained clearly. This is the kind of concrete, graspable content the site needs more of.
- "Play as Agent" button — intriguing! Can I actually participate in the simulation?
- The "What to Watch For" section primes me to look for coalition formation, defector isolation, cooperation cascades. Good observational scaffolding.
- "The Core Question" framing — can self-interested agents develop cooperation without central authority? — is compelling and makes the whole thing feel purposeful.
- Clicked: Went to Lab Console.
- Confusion points: Animated vs Instant toggle — what's the difference in practice? Are these pre-computed or live?

### Lab Console (18:00)
- This felt like a developer tool rather than a visitor-facing page. "Select a mode below and click 'Load data' to explore different scenarios."
- Mode options: EP Closed Loop, Maturation Demo, Five Domain EP, Multi-Life with Policy, One Life with Policy. These labels assume I already understand the concepts.
- The "Load cached" and "Run simulation" buttons require "Python + web4/game setup" — so this is not for casual visitors at all.
- "Load static" uses pre-generated data, which I could try, but the page was stuck at "Loading life data..." with no results appearing.
- This page should probably be gated or clearly marked as "advanced / developer tool" so visitors don't hit it early and get confused.
- Clicked: Went to Glossary.
- Confusion points: What is "EP Closed Loop"? What is "Five Domain EP"? None of these modes are explained inline. The status message "Loading life data..." just hangs.

### Glossary (20:00)
- Comprehensive and well-organized. Plain-English definitions for all the acronyms I've been encountering.
- The two-tier structure (Core Concepts + Advanced Concepts) is sensible.
- I found myself wishing I'd come here much earlier. The definitions of ATP, LCT, T3, and MRH here are clearer than on any other page.
- The "Society Membership" section (Joining, Active, Ejection, Reintegration, Exhaustion) tells a story — I can see the lifecycle now.
- The "Agent Type Comparison Table" (humans vs embodied AI vs software AI) was eye-opening. I hadn't realized this system was designed for AI agents too.
- The terminology rationale at the bottom ("Jargon can alienate. This glossary exists because we'd rather serve genuinely curious people deeply.") was a nice touch.
- Clicked: Went to LCT Explainer for a deep dive.
- Confusion points: Some of the advanced concepts (EP, V3, Heterogeneous Review) still flew over my head, but that's expected for a glossary's advanced section.

### LCT Explainer (22:00)
- The identity evolution section (Web2 passwords → Web3 wallet keys → Web4 witness verification) was the single most effective explanation on the entire site. The progression is clear, each step builds on the last, and the "Key Insight" callout nails why Web4 is different.
- The LCT example format (`lct:web4:agent:alice.assistant1@Thor#perception`) was dense but the breakdown of each component was helpful.
- The interactive security comparison (Password Database Breach across Web2/Web3/Web4) was compelling.
- The supported hardware platforms table made this feel real — phones, security keys, TPM chips, multi-device setups. These are things I actually have.
- The task types table with ATP budgets was interesting but raised questions about who sets these budgets and why.
- **Strength**: This is the best-designed explainer page on the site. Progressive disclosure, concrete examples, interactive elements, real-world grounding.
- Clicked: Went to ATP Economics.
- Confusion points: The dual signature verification process was a bit abstract. I understood the concept but not exactly how it would work in practice.

### ATP Economics (25:00)
- The biological metaphor (organisms have metabolic budgets) clicked for me. "Every action costs attention. Run out? You die." Simple. Effective.
- The interactive simulator (start with 100 ATP, choose actions) was the clearest demonstration of the concept. Spam costs -5 net, high-value creation earns +30 net. The economics are obvious.
- The multi-life simulation data showing ATP across four lifecycles was good — I could see how value contributors accumulate while non-contributors die.
- The "Death is Meaningful" insight is important — this is what separates Web4 from every other system where bans are just temporary inconveniences.
- The comparison table (Traditional Tokens vs ATP) helped distinguish this from cryptocurrency, which was a question I had.
- Clicked: Went to Trust Tensors.
- Confusion points: ADP (discharge packets) was mentioned but felt unnecessary at this stage. The implementation pseudocode is for developers, not visitors.

### Trust Tensor (27:00)
- The five dimensions (competence, reliability, integrity, alignment, transparency) make intuitive sense. I can map these to real-world trust assessments.
- The interactive simulator showing how scenarios affect different dimensions was engaging. "Missed deadline without warning" tanks reliability and transparency but barely touches competence — that feels right.
- The Expert vs Reliable candidate comparison was the best illustration: high competence (95%) with low reliability (40%) vs balanced trust across dimensions. Clear winner for critical work.
- The "gaming requires trustworthiness across all dimensions" point is key — you can't fake five dimensions simultaneously.
- Clicked: Went to Aliveness.
- Confusion points: The tensor mathematics in the technical details section was opaque. How exactly is T3 computed? The page shows the dimensions but not the aggregation.

### Aliveness (29:00)
- The three simultaneous conditions (ATP > 0, T3 > 0.5, CI coherent) gave me a clear framework. I can now understand what "alive" means in this context.
- The death and rebirth system was well-explained. Three death conditions, rebirth requires T3 ≥ 0.5, karma carries forward. This maps cleanly to what I learned on the ATP page.
- The physics foundation section (0.5 threshold from coherence physics) was interesting but I'm not sure it's convincing to a lay visitor. It feels like retrofitting a justification.
- The interactive calculator (100 ATP, 0.65 T3, 0.85 CI → ALIVE) was a nice verification of my understanding.
- The three-life example (Novice → Maturing → Established) tied everything together.
- Clicked: Went to How It Works.
- Confusion points: The CI modulation formulas were too technical. I trust that the system works but can't verify the math.

### How It Works (31:00)
- This page is a masterclass in progressive disclosure. It walks through Birth → Life → Death → Rebirth with concrete numbers at every step.
- The action cost table (reading: 1 ATP, posting: 10-20 ATP, broadcasting: 20-50 ATP) made the economics tangible.
- The trust evolution examples (delivering quality work: +0.15 competence, +0.20 reliability vs. missing deadline: -0.25 reliability) were crystal clear.
- The three-life progression example at the bottom was the most complete demonstration of the whole system working together.
- **This should be much more prominent in the navigation.** It's the single best overview page and I found it relatively late.
- Clicked: Went to Decision Evolution as a final exploration.
- Confusion points: Minimal — this page does a good job connecting all the concepts. The "Launch Lab Console" CTA at the bottom is a trap though, since the Lab Console requires local setup.

### Decision Evolution (33:00)
- "How agents get better at making decisions across lives" — this is a fascinating layer but I'm now deep in advanced territory.
- The EP Learning concept (extract patterns, not memories) was interesting but abstract.
- The Life 1 → Life 2 → Life 3 decision timeline showing wisdom increasing from 0.35 to higher was cool but I couldn't interact with it.
- The comparison table (EP Learning vs Traditional AI Learning) was useful for AI-literate visitors but might lose others.
- This is clearly advanced content. I understood the concept but not the implementation.

## Friction Log

| Location | Issue | Severity | Suggestion |

## Understanding Gained

By the end of this session, I understood:
- [x] What Web4 is (at a high level)
- [x] What 4-Life is trying to demonstrate
- [x] What LCT means
- [x] What ATP/ADP means
- [x] What Trust Tensors are
- [x] How agents "live" and "die"
- [ ] Why any of this matters

## Unanswered Questions

1. **Who is this actually for?** Is Web4 something I'd use as a consumer? A developer building platforms? A researcher? The site oscillates between casual explainer and technical specification without committing to an audience.
2. **Where's the simulation?** First Contact promises a 10-minute interactive tutorial with Alice. Where is it? The button doesn't work.
3. **Has anyone built anything with this?** The site mentions theoretical/research stage but I saw no examples of even prototype implementations beyond these simulations.
4. **How does this interact with existing platforms?** If I wanted to use Web4 trust on Twitter or Discord, how would that work? Federation is mentioned but never demonstrated.
5. **What's the incentive for platforms to adopt this?** Platforms profit from lock-in. Why would they adopt portable reputation that weakens their moat?
6. **Why should I care right now?** The problems are real but the solution is theoretical. The site hasn't convinced me that Web4 is closer to reality than any other internet reform proposal.
7. **Who decides the ATP costs?** The action cost table shows reading costs 1 ATP and broadcasting costs 20-50 ATP, but who sets these numbers? A central authority? Each society? This feels like a governance question that isn't addressed.
8. **What happens to people who can't afford hardware security keys?** The LCT system requires TPM/Secure Enclave/FIDO2. What about accessibility and economic equity?

## Honest Assessment

The site is ambitious and clearly built with care. The individual explainer pages — especially the LCT Explainer, ATP Economics, and How It Works — are genuinely well-crafted. They follow a problem-before-solution structure, use concrete examples, and build understanding progressively. When the site is at its best, I found myself thinking "okay, that actually makes sense."

But the experience as a whole is fractured. The guided learning path (Why Web4 → First Contact → Playground) breaks at First Contact because the simulation doesn't exist. This is the single most damaging issue: the site promises a 10-minute guided journey and then fails to deliver it. A visitor who hits that dead button will bounce.

The site also can't decide who it's for. The landing page and Why Web4 speak to a general audience concerned about internet trust problems. But pages like Lab Console, Decision Evolution, and the technical details sections speak to developers and researchers. The Glossary tries to bridge this gap and mostly succeeds, but the overall navigation doesn't guide different audiences to their appropriate content.

The **How It Works** page is the hidden gem. It should be much more prominent — it's the single best "I want to understand the whole thing in one sitting" resource. If the First Contact simulation can't be built soon, How It Works should take its place in the learning path.

The acronym density is a real barrier. By the time I encountered MRH (my fourth new acronym in two minutes), I was mentally exhausted. The biological metaphor (ATP as metabolic energy) is brilliant and intuitive, but the other acronyms (LCT, T3, MRH, CI, EP, V3, R6) don't have that same natural resonance. Consider whether some of these need friendlier names for the visitor-facing content, reserving the acronyms for technical documentation.

I left the site understanding the mechanism (how Web4 would work) but not fully convinced of the significance (why I should care today). The "Why This Matters" question in the understanding checklist is the hardest one to check off. The problems are real, the solution is elegant, but the gap between "theoretical simulation" and "something that affects my life" is still wide. The site needs a "So What?" page that bridges simulation to real-world impact.

Overall: intellectually stimulating, structurally uneven, and one broken button away from losing most visitors at the critical moment.
