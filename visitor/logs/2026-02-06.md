## Journey

### Landing Page (00:00)
- First impression: "The Internet Has a Trust Problem" — yes, I agree. Good hook. I feel seen.
- Then: "Web4 is a trust-native internet where identity costs something, actions have metabolic weight, and consequences follow you forever." — Wait. "Metabolic weight"? What does that mean in a digital context? "Trust-native"? These aren't terms I know. Feels like I walked into a conversation already in progress.
- The four pillars (identity, attention, consequences, AI coexistence) make conceptual sense but use insider language: "hardware-bound," "metabolic," "ATP." I don't know what ATP means yet.
- The recommended learning path (Why Web4? → First Contact → Playground) is very helpful — tells me exactly where to go. I clicked "Why Web4?"
- Confusion points: "metabolic weight" is completely unexplained. What is ATP? The landing page name-drops it without defining it.
- The nav bar only has "Whitepaper" — no menu, no sitemap. Where's the rest of the site?

### Why Web4? (02:30)
- This page is significantly better. The five problems are real and relatable — spam, siloed reputation, unlimited fresh starts, AI making it worse, platform control. I'm nodding along.
- "Why Previous Solutions Failed" is smart — anticipates my "but what about..." objections. Moderation, CAPTCHAs, Web3, social login all addressed.
- "What Would Actually Work" — five requirements listed. Clear and logical.
- Then the acronym dump: ATP, LCT, T3, MRH. Four acronyms in rapid succession with one-line explanations each. I can sort of parse them but it's a lot to absorb at once.
- The "Honest Questions" FAQ is refreshingly candid. Admitting "this is research, not production" and "bootstrapping is genuinely hard" builds trust. The question about hardware loss is practical and well-answered.
- Confusion points: Four acronyms introduced simultaneously. MRH ("Markov Relevancy Horizon") is particularly opaque — I have no idea what Markov means in this context.
- The site taught me: the problem framing. I inferred: how the solutions connect to each other.

### First Contact (06:00)
- Promises "10-minute interactive tutorial, zero jargon." Great!
- Shows "Step 1 of 5" with a progress indicator. Good structure.
- Four core concepts listed with emoji icons: ATP (attention economics), Trust (reputation), Consequences (permanent record), Self-Regulation (no moderators).
- Then a "How This Works" section: Watch Alice, read the story, understand mechanisms, explore further.
- "Start Simulation" button. I'd click it... but what happens? Is it an animation? A game? A video? The page doesn't tell me what to expect. I feel uncertain about clicking.
- Confusion points: The promise of "zero jargon" is immediately broken — "metabolic economics" is jargon. Also, "Start Simulation" with no preview or hint of what I'll see is a small friction point.
- Note: I didn't see steps 2-5. Is this because the simulation hasn't started yet? The UX is unclear about whether this is a description page or the tutorial itself.

### How It Works (08:00)
- Five mechanisms listed in a grid: Identity (LCT), Economics (ATP), Trust (T3), Coherence (CI), Context (MRH). Five acronyms. My eyes are glazing slightly.
- BUT — the lifecycle section (Birth → Life → Death → Rebirth) is excellent. Concrete, step-by-step, with actual numbers. "Born with 100 ATP." "Reading messages costs 1 ATP." "High-quality post: cost 15, earn 40, net +25." NOW I get it. These numbers make the abstraction concrete.
- The three-life walkthrough (Novice → Maturing → Established) is the best teaching moment on the site so far. I can see the progression. Life 2 has an "ATP crisis at 15" — dramatic! Life 3 achieves mastery. This is a story I can follow.
- The "Why This Design Works" section reinforces the key points clearly.
- Confusion points: The page is LONG. Very long. I started skimming after the lifecycle section. The technical details at the bottom are overwhelming for a first visit.
- The site taught me: How ATP works in practice (the numbers helped enormously). I inferred: the connection between trust and rebirth.

### ATP Economics (11:00)
- The interactive simulator is great. Four buttons: send spam (-5), low-quality post (net -5), meaningful contribution (net +10), high-value creation (net +30). Starting with 100 ATP. I can immediately see how spam drains you and quality sustains you.
- The multi-life simulation data showing an agent across four lifecycles is compelling.
- The comparison table (ATP vs Traditional Tokens) is useful — "non-transferable" and "use or lose" immediately distinguish this from crypto.
- The "ATP/ADP" distinction is introduced here but ADP isn't really explained clearly. What's the difference? ATP is the budget, ADP is... discharged after audit? That's vague.
- Confusion points: ADP explanation is weak. "Allocation Discharge Packets recording action metadata, then discharged after audit" — I don't know what that means in practice.

### Glossary (13:00)
- Massive page. Goes from basic concepts (Web4, LCT, ATP) to extremely advanced ones (Modal Awareness, Cumulative Identity Context, Confabulation Patterns).
- The basic definitions are helpful. The advanced section lost me completely.
- "Coherence Thresholds: Identity stability requires coherence metric D9 ≥ 0.7" — what is D9? Not defined on this page.
- The terminology rationale at the bottom is interesting — explains why biological metaphors were chosen. This should be higher up.
- Confusion points: No separation between "start here" and "deep dive" concepts. The page treats everything as equally important. A visitor who lands here will be overwhelmed.

### Playground (14:30)
- Parameter Playground with sliders. Quick Presets (Easy Mode, Hard Mode, etc.) are a nice touch — I don't have to understand all parameters to start.
- "Run Simulation" button is clear. Reset button available. Good.
- But I don't know what "Ticks per Life" means, or what "Risk Appetite" controls exactly. The descriptions are minimal.
- Quick presets help but I want to know: what am I looking at when the simulation runs? What does the output look like?
- Confusion points: "Ticks per Life" and "Karma Compression" are unexplained.

### Society Simulator (15:30)
- Five agent strategies: Cooperator, Defector, Reciprocator, Cautious, Adaptive. These are immediately understandable — feels like game theory (Prisoner's Dilemma vibes).
- "Play as Agent" button is exciting. I can participate, not just watch.
- Scenario presets (Cooperative Majority, Hostile World, etc.) give me interesting experiments to try.
- This is one of the most accessible pages on the site. The game theory framing makes Web4 mechanisms tangible.
- Confusion points: Minimal — this page works well.

### LCT Explainer (17:00)
- The Web2 vs Web3 vs Web4 identity comparison table is immediately clarifying. Passwords → Wallet Keys → Hardware-witnessed identity. The progression makes sense.
- The five things an LCT proves are clear and concrete.
- The device witness slider is a good interactive element — shows how more witnesses = harder to compromise.
- The security comparison table (six attack scenarios across Web2/Web3/Web4) is excellent. Practical and concrete.
- BUT — the technical details section goes deep fast. "Dual Signature Verification Process," "Supported Hardware Platforms Table," "Standardized Task Types Table" — this is spec-level detail that I don't need on a first visit.
- Confusion points: The page is split between "very accessible comparison tables" and "very technical specification detail." The transition is jarring.

### Trust Tensor (18:30)
- Five dimensions (Competence, Reliability, Integrity, Alignment, Transparency) with emoji icons — clear and memorable.
- The interactive simulator with six scenarios is good. I can click and see how each action affects different dimensions differently.
- Candidate A vs Candidate B comparison is THE BEST teaching moment on the entire site. "The Expert" (high competence, low reliability) vs "The Reliable" (balanced across all dimensions). For critical infrastructure, B wins despite lower competence. I GET IT now. Multi-dimensional trust isn't abstract anymore.
- Confusion points: The technical details section mentions "T3 vs V3" — what's V3? Another tensor? How many tensors are there?

### Aliveness (20:00)
- Core definition: ATP > 0 + T3 > 0.5 + CI coherent = alive. Three conditions. Clear.
- Death is real. Rebirth requires trust. Got it.
- The interactive calculator with three sliders is a nice touch.
- BUT — the 0.5 threshold explanation goes into physics: superconductivity, BEC, laser coherence, quantum systems. This is fascinating but completely unnecessary for understanding Web4. It feels like the author is showing their work rather than teaching me.
- The comparison table (Traditional Web vs Web4 Aliveness) is excellent though.
- Confusion points: The physics tangent is alienating. "Phase transition point" is unnecessary jargon for a newcomer.

### MRH / Markov Relevancy Horizon (22:00)
- "You see what's relevant, nothing more" — okay, I get the concept. It's like a visibility horizon based on relationships.
- The three relationship types (Bound, Paired, Witnessed) are clear with emoji.
- Role-specific MRH ("Alice-as-surgeon" vs "Alice-as-car-owner") is an interesting concept.
- But "Markov" is never explained in plain English. Why is it called "Markov"? What's Markov about it? The page says "future decisions depend on present state, not full history" but doesn't connect that to why I should care.
- Confusion points: The name itself is the biggest barrier. "Context Horizon" or "Relationship Horizon" would be instantly clearer.

### Narratives (23:00)
- Empty page. "No narratives found. Run a simulation in the Lab Console to generate one."
- Dead end. I came here hoping to see stories about Web4 agents but there's nothing.
- Confusion points: Why is this page linked from the navigation if there's no content? Feels like a broken feature.

### Lab Console (23:30)
- Five simulation modes available (EP Closed Loop, Maturation Demo, etc.)
- "Load static" uses pre-generated data — good, I can try this.
- BUT: "Load cached and Run simulation require Python + web4/game setup." — This is a dead end for 95% of web visitors. I'm not going to install Python to explore a website.
- Confusion points: The most powerful tool on the site is gated behind a local development setup. "Load static" is the only viable option for me, and it's not clear what I'll see.

## Friction Log

| Location | Issue | Severity | Suggestion |
|----------|-------|----------|------------|

## Understanding Gained

By the end of this session, I understood:
- [x] What Web4 is (at a high level)
- [x] What 4-Life is trying to demonstrate
- [ ] What LCT means — I understand it's hardware-bound identity, but the mechanics (witnessing, constellations) remain fuzzy
- [x] What ATP/ADP means — ATP yes (attention budget), ADP no (still unclear)
- [x] What Trust Tensors are — the Candidate A vs B example cemented this
- [x] How agents "live" and "die" — the lifecycle on How It Works was clear
- [x] Why any of this matters — the problem framing on Why Web4 was compelling

## Unanswered Questions

1. **Who is building this?** There's no "About" or "Team" page. Is this one person? A research group? A company? I have no idea who's behind it.
2. **Is this actually deployed anywhere?** The FAQ says "theoretical with working simulations" but I can't tell if anyone is using this in the real world.
3. **How would I actually use Web4?** If I wanted to participate, what would I do? Buy a hardware key? Install software? Join a community? The site explains the theory but not the practical first step.
4. **What's the relationship between 4-Life (the site) and Web4 (the protocol)?** Is 4-Life just a simulator? A reference implementation? Part of the spec?
5. **Why "4-Life"?** The name is never explained. Is it "for life" (permanent identity)? A play on cellular automata (Game of Life)? Something else?
6. **What does ADP actually do in practice?** ATP is clear (budget), but ADP's role is murky.
7. **How does cross-society interaction work?** Federation is mentioned but never shown. If I'm trusted in Society A, what happens when I enter Society B?
8. **What happens to my data?** Is my trust tensor stored on a blockchain? On my device? On a server? The privacy implications are unclear.
9. **Why are there so many acronyms?** Seriously — LCT, ATP, ADP, T3, V3, CI, MRH, EP, R6, R7, D9. That's 11 acronyms for one system. Is there a simpler way to think about this?
10. **What's the timeline?** Is this a 1-year project? 10-year? Has it been going for a while? Is it just starting?

## Honest Assessment

The site is ambitious and the ideas are genuinely interesting. The problem framing is excellent — "The Internet Has a Trust Problem" is a hook that works because it's true. The "Why Web4?" page is the strongest piece of content on the site and should be the model for all other pages.

**What works:**
- Problem-first framing throughout
- The biology metaphor (alive, dead, metabolic) is memorable once you understand it
- Interactive simulators give hands-on understanding
- The Candidate A vs B trust comparison is the single best teaching moment
- The Honest Questions FAQ builds genuine trust by admitting limitations
- The Society Simulator is immediately accessible (game theory framing)

**What doesn't work:**
- Acronym overload is the #1 problem. Eleven acronyms is too many. By the time I've learned ATP and T3, I've forgotten what MRH stands for. The site needs a "jargon budget."
- Several pages are dead ends (Narratives is empty, Lab Console needs Python). Dead ends erode trust in the site itself.
- The glossary is a wall of text with no difficulty gradient. A newcomer who opens the glossary will feel overwhelmed, not helped.
- Navigation is minimal — the site has dozens of pages but the nav bar only shows "Whitepaper." Finding things requires following links from page to page, which means missing content that isn't linked from your current path.
- The physics tangent on the Aliveness page (superconductivity, BEC) feels like showing off rather than teaching. It's fascinating to someone who already understands, but alienating to a newcomer.
- "First Contact" promises an interactive tutorial but feels more like a description page with a mysterious "Start Simulation" button. The gap between promise and delivery creates mild disappointment.

**Overall:** I left understanding the core ideas (trust as multidimensional, attention as scarce resource, identity as permanent) but feeling like the site is built for insiders, not newcomers. The recommended learning path helps, but individual pages oscillate between "wonderfully clear" and "drowning in jargon." The site would benefit enormously from a strict jargon budget and a navigation overhaul.

I'd give it a **B-** for a first-time visitor experience. The ideas are A-tier. The presentation is C+ to B depending on the page. The interactive elements bump it up. The dead ends and acronym overload drag it down.
