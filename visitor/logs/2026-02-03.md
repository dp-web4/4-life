## Journey

### Landing Page (00:00)
- First impression: Slick, but immediately hit with jargon I don't understand. "Web4 societies," "trust-native," "metabolic attention systems" - what?
- What made sense: The problem statement about spam and free accounts resonated. "Spam wins because accounts are free" is a clear pitch.
- Confusion points: "Hardware-bound identities," "metabolic attention," "permanent consequences" - these are introduced without explanation
- Clicked: "Why Web4" seemed like the natural place to learn what this is

### Why Web4 Page (02:00)
- This page is actually good at explaining the *problem*. I recognize all five issues (spam, siloed reputation, no consequences, AI fakes, centralized control).
- But then it dumps four acronyms: ATP, LCT, T3, MRH with one-liner explanations. I still don't understand any of them.
- The one-liners are too abstract: "ATP: Actions cost resources; quality earns them back" - what does that actually mean in practice?
- Clicked: "First Contact" because it says "10-minute tutorial"

### First Contact Page (05:00)
- This page promises a tutorial but I didn't find the actual interactive content easily
- It describes what I'll learn but doesn't teach it directly on the page
- There's apparently a "Start Simulation" button that launches the real experience
- Frustration: I wanted to read/learn, not necessarily click into a simulation yet
- Clicked: Decided to try the Playground instead

### Playground Page (07:00)
- There are sliders and controls for things like "Lives," "Ticks per Life," "ATP," "Trust"
- But I don't understand what an "agent" is doing. What actions is it taking? Why?
- The UI shows controls without explaining what I'm controlling
- Missing: A sentence like "The agent tries to interact with other agents. Each interaction costs ATP. Good interactions earn ATP back."
- I couldn't make sense of the controls without first understanding the game

### Society Simulator Page (10:00)
- NOW I get it! Agents interact with each other (cooperate or defect)
- There are different strategies: Cooperator, Defector, Reciprocator, etc.
- ATP is the energy budget, Trust determines who interacts with you
- This is basically a game theory simulation with economic consequences
- Frustration: Why wasn't this explained FIRST? This context makes everything else make sense

### How It Works Page (13:00)
- THIS is the page I needed from the beginning!
- Clear lifecycle: Birth (100 ATP, 0.5 trust) → Life (spend ATP on actions, earn it back for good ones) → Death (ATP = 0) → Rebirth (if trust ≥ 0.5, with karma bonus)
- The metabolism metaphor finally clicks. Actions cost energy. Good behavior is sustainable. Bad behavior burns out.
- This page should be WAY more prominent. Maybe even the landing page content.

### ATP Economics Page (16:00)
- Confirms what I learned: actions cost ATP, good contributions net positive, spam nets negative
- Clear cost/reward examples: Spam costs 5 ATP, earns nothing. Meaningful contribution costs 15, earns 25.
- "Sustainability principle" is key: you survive only if earnings exceed spending

### LCT Explainer Page (18:00)
- Hardware-bound identity using secure enclaves, TPM chips, FIDO2 keys
- Multi-device attestation increases trust ceiling
- Makes sense: you can't create infinite accounts because each needs real hardware
- Fairly technical but understandable

### Trust Tensor Page (20:00)
- Trust has 5 dimensions: competence, reliability, integrity, alignment, transparency
- Different contexts weight these differently
- You can't game all dimensions at once - nice insight
- The Candidate A vs B example was helpful

### MRH Page (22:00)
- Still the most confusing concept
- Basically: your visibility is bounded by your relationship network (3 degrees of separation)
- Like a social filter - you don't see the whole world, just your graph
- I sort of get it but it's abstract

### Glossary Page (24:00)
- Helpful reference! All terms in one place
- But I discovered even MORE acronyms I hadn't encountered (CI, R6, EP, V3...)
- Feels like there's a whole iceberg of concepts under the surface

## Friction Log
| Location | Issue | Severity | Suggestion |
|----------|-------|----------|------------|
| Landing Page | Jargon without explanation | HIGH | Explain "metabolic attention," "trust-native" before using them |
| Landing Page | Four pillars mentioned but not explained | MEDIUM | Link each pillar directly to its explainer page with hover tooltips |
| Why Web4 | Acronym dump (ATP, LCT, T3, MRH) | HIGH | Show don't tell - give a concrete example of each in action |
| First Contact | Tutorial is promised but not delivered inline | MEDIUM | Embed the actual tutorial content or make the CTA more obvious |
| Playground | Controls without context | HIGH | Add one sentence explaining what the agent actually does |
| Playground | No "What am I looking at?" section | MEDIUM | Brief orientation before showing sliders |
| How It Works | Buried too deep in navigation | HIGH | This should be linked directly from landing page, or BE the landing page |
| MRH Page | Most abstract concept, needs concrete example | MEDIUM | Show a visual diagram of what Alice can and can't see |

## Understanding Gained
By the end of this session, I understood:
- [x] What Web4 is (at a high level) — trust-native infrastructure where identity costs something and behavior has consequences
- [x] What 4-Life is trying to demonstrate — how a society of agents self-regulates through economic/trust mechanisms without central authority
- [x] What LCT means — hardware-bound unforgeable identity
- [x] What ATP/ADP means — metabolic energy budget for actions (ATP = currency, ADP = spent record)
- [x] What Trust Tensors are — multi-dimensional reputation scores across competence, reliability, integrity, alignment, transparency
- [x] How agents "live" and "die" — ATP depletion = death, trust ≥ 0.5 enables rebirth with karma
- [ ] Why any of this matters — I get the anti-spam argument but I'm not sure why regular users would want this

## Unanswered Questions
1. Why would a regular person choose Web4 over current systems? What's the user benefit, not just the spam-prevention benefit?
2. How does this actually get adopted? Who runs the hardware infrastructure?
3. Is this meant to replace social media accounts? Email? All internet identity?
4. What happens if I lose my hardware (phone breaks)? Do I lose my identity/karma?
5. Who validates "quality contributions" and assigns ATP rewards? Is that centralized?
6. How does this relate to AI agents specifically? The landing page mentions AI but most content is about humans.

## Honest Assessment

As a genuine first-time visitor with zero Web4 background, this site is **ambitious but front-loads confusion**.

The core idea is actually elegant once you get it: make online actions cost something (like metabolic energy), reward good behavior, let bad actors burn out naturally. The metabolism metaphor is genuinely insightful.

But the onboarding path is inverted. The landing page and early pages throw jargon and acronyms at you before building the foundation. I had to dig to "How It Works" and "Society Simulator" to finally understand what I was looking at. Once I understood the lifecycle (birth → life → death → rebirth), everything else clicked into place.

**What worked:**
- The problem framing (spam, silos, no consequences) is relatable
- The "How It Works" page is excellent and should be much more prominent
- The glossary is a good reference
- The Society Simulator made the abstract concepts tangible

**What didn't work:**
- Jargon on the landing page before concepts are explained
- Four acronyms introduced with one-liners that don't really explain anything
- Playground has controls without explaining what you're controlling
- First Contact promises a tutorial but doesn't deliver it inline
- The "why this matters to ME" is never clearly stated

**My recommendation for improvement:**
Lead with the lifecycle story: "Imagine every online action costs energy. Good contributions earn it back. Spam burns out. Your reputation follows you everywhere." THEN introduce the acronyms as names for these concepts. Show before tell.

The content is there. The onboarding order just needs work.
