## Journey

### Landing Page (00:00)
- First impression: Clean, clear problem statement up front. "Spam wins because accounts are free" immediately resonates.
- The four Web4 principles (Hardware-bound Identity, Metabolic Attention, Permanent Consequences, Universal Framework) give a good overview without overwhelming.
- The recommended path (Why Web4 → First Contact → Playground) is helpful.
- Confusion points: "Metabolic Attention" is an unusual phrase — I wasn't sure what it meant until reading further.
- Clicked: Why Web4 (following the recommended path)

### Why Web4 (01:30)
- This page is excellent. It starts with the problem ("The Internet Has a Trust Problem") and explains WHY current solutions fail before introducing Web4's approach.
- The critique of existing solutions (moderation, CAPTCHAs, blockchain identity, social login) is compelling.
- Acronyms introduced: ATP, LCT, T3, MRH — each gets a one-liner but I don't fully understand them yet.
- Appreciated: The disclaimer that this is "currently theoretical with working simulations" — honest about status.
- Confusion points: The acronyms need more context. What does "Allocation Transfer Packet" actually mean in practice?
- Clicked: First Contact

### First Contact (04:00)
- Simpler summary of the four core concepts.
- The "watch Alice build reputation" framing is approachable.
- Links to learning journey and how-it-works are clear.
- Confusion points: This felt like a recap of the landing page more than new information. Not sure what to click next.
- Clicked: How It Works

### How It Works (05:30)
- This is the meat. The five mechanisms (Identity/LCT, Economics/ATP, Trust/T3, Coherence/CI, Context/MRH) are explained with more depth.
- The lifecycle section (Birth → Life → Death → Rebirth) finally made ATP click for me — it's like metabolic energy for digital actions.
- The ATP cost/reward table is concrete and helpful (posting costs 15 ATP, quality contribution earns 40 ATP = net +25).
- The rebirth mechanic is interesting — good actors can come back, bad actors die permanently.
- Confusion points: "Epistemic Proprioception" is jargon overload. I skipped that paragraph.
- Clicked: ATP Economics

### ATP Economics (08:00)
- Good reinforcement of the metabolic budget concept.
- The "spend vs earn" framing makes sense now.
- Death/rebirth with karma explained clearly.
- The practical example with the 4-life agent helped.
- Confusion points: None major — this page landed well after reading How It Works.
- Clicked: Trust Tensor

### Trust Tensor (10:00)
- Multi-dimensional trust makes intuitive sense — you can trust someone's competence but not their reliability.
- The five dimensions (competence, reliability, integrity, alignment, transparency) are clear.
- Appreciated: The explanation that trust updates are dimension-specific, not a single score.
- Confusion points: The mention of "canonical 3D version" (Talent, Training, Temperament) is confusing — why introduce a different model?
- Clicked: Identity Constellation

### Identity Constellation / LCT (11:30)
- Hardware-bound identity is a compelling concept.
- The "enrollment ceremony" with multiple devices as witnesses makes sense.
- "Compromise MULTIPLE independent hardware chips" as the attack requirement is a clear security improvement.
- Confusion points: How would this work for someone with only one device? Is a FIDO2 key mandatory?
- Clicked: Aliveness

### Aliveness (13:00)
- The three criteria (ATP > 0, T3 > 0.5, CI coherent) as requirements for "aliveness" is clear.
- Death mechanics spelled out: metabolic death, coherence death, trust collapse.
- Rebirth eligibility based on T3 score creates real consequences.
- Confusion points: The 0.5 threshold for T3 seems arbitrary — why that number?
- Clicked: Playground

### Playground (14:30)
- Interactive parameter adjustment is a good learning tool.
- The presets (Easy Mode, Hard Mode, etc.) lower the barrier to experimentation.
- The four-step workflow is clear.
- Confusion points: I didn't actually run a simulation (WebFetch can't interact with JavaScript). Would need to visit in a real browser.
- Clicked: Learn

### Learning Journey (15:30)
- Structured curriculum with four tracks (Beginner through Practitioner) is well-organized.
- Estimated times for each concept are helpful.
- "Concrete before abstract" pedagogical approach sounds right.
- Confusion points: None — this is a good roadmap.
- Clicked: Lab Console

### Lab Console (16:30)
- Multiple simulation modes available.
- The "Load static" option that doesn't require Python setup is visitor-friendly.
- Confusion points: What's the difference between "EP Closed Loop" and "Maturation Demo"? No explanation given.
- Clicked: Why It Matters (tried to find)

### Why It Matters (17:30)
- **404 Not Found** — This page doesn't exist.
- This is a significant gap. After learning WHAT Web4 is and HOW it works, I wanted to understand WHY this matters in the real world.
- Clicked: Coherence Index

### Coherence Index (18:00)
- The geometric mean approach ensuring "one low score drastically reduces overall CI" is clever.
- Four dimensions (spatial, capability, temporal, relational) are concrete.
- Confusion points: The math example (0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.1)^(1/4) = 0.48 is helpful but assumes math comfort.

### Markov Relevancy Horizon (18:30)
- "You see what's relevant to your connections" is intuitive.
- The three relationship types (Bound, Paired, Witnessed) are new vocabulary but explained.
- Trust decay through hops (0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 = 0.73) makes sense.
- Confusion points: The term "Markov Relevancy Horizon" is intimidating. Could be called "Relationship Visibility" or something simpler.

## Friction Log
| Location | Issue | Severity | Suggestion |
|----------|-------|----------|------------|
| Landing Page | "Metabolic Attention" is unclear jargon | low | Add brief parenthetical: "(actions cost energy)" |
| Why Web4 | Acronyms (ATP, LCT, T3, MRH) dumped without sufficient context | medium | Link to anchor explanations or add one-sentence definitions |
| First Contact | Feels redundant after landing page | low | Differentiate more clearly or consolidate |
| How It Works | "Epistemic Proprioception" is jargon overload | medium | Simplify to "learning from experience across lives" |
| Trust Tensor | "Canonical 3D version" mention is confusing | low | Remove or explain why there are two models |
| Identity Constellation | Single-device users unclear | medium | Address what happens with only one device |
| Aliveness | 0.5 threshold seems arbitrary | low | Explain why 0.5 is the threshold |
| Lab Console | Simulation modes unexplained | medium | Add brief descriptions of what each mode demonstrates |
| Site-wide | **"Why It Matters" page missing (404)** | **high** | Create this page — it's the natural "so what?" conclusion |
| MRH page | "Markov Relevancy Horizon" is intimidating name | low | Consider simpler terminology in intro |

## Understanding Gained
By the end of this session, I understood:
- [x] What Web4 is (at a high level)
- [x] What 4-Life is trying to demonstrate
- [x] What LCT means
- [x] What ATP/ADP means
- [x] What Trust Tensors are
- [x] How agents "live" and "die"
- [ ] Why any of this matters — **page missing**

## Unanswered Questions
1. **Why should I care?** The mechanics are clear, but the "so what" is missing. How does this improve my actual life?
2. **Who is building this?** Is this a research project? A startup? An open-source community?
3. **What's the timeline?** When might any of this become real?
4. **How do I participate?** If I'm convinced, what's my next step beyond reading?
5. **What are the risks/downsides?** The site only presents benefits. What could go wrong?
6. **How does this relate to existing identity systems?** Can Web4 coexist with passwords, OAuth, etc.?

## Honest Assessment

The site has improved significantly. The landing page's problem-first approach is effective — I immediately understood why current internet trust is broken. The "Why Web4" page does excellent work critiquing existing solutions before presenting Web4's approach.

The core mechanics (ATP, LCT, T3, CI, MRH) are well-explained across dedicated pages, though the acronym soup can feel overwhelming when first encountered. The biological metaphor (metabolic energy, death, rebirth) is intuitive once it clicks.

**What works well:**
- Problem-first framing on landing page
- Clear recommended navigation path
- Concrete examples (ATP costs, trust dimensions)
- Honest disclaimer that this is theoretical/simulation
- Progressive disclosure through page structure

**What's missing:**
- A "Why It Matters" page connecting mechanics to real-world impact
- More approachable entry point for the simulation tools (Lab Console modes are unexplained)
- Clear call-to-action for visitors who are convinced
- Team/project context (who's behind this?)

**Overall**: I understand the WHAT and HOW. I'm left wanting the WHY (real-world impact) and the WHO (team, project status). For a curious technical visitor, this is engaging. For someone less technical or more skeptical, the acronym density might be a barrier.

I would return to explore the Playground in a real browser. I might recommend to someone interested in digital identity/trust, but I'd caveat that it's dense and theoretical.
