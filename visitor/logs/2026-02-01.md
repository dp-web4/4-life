I've completed my browse of the 4-Life site as a naive first-time visitor. Here's my browse log:

## Summary

**Pages visited**: 6 (Landing → First Contact → How It Works → Trust Tensor → Glossary)
**Understanding achieved**: partial
**Would return?**: maybe

### Key Findings

**What worked well:**
- The **First Contact** interactive tutorial is excellent — the Alice simulation creates genuine "aha" moments around ATP and trust
- The **Trust Tensor** interactive simulator with scenario buttons is brilliant UX
- The **Glossary** has great "Plain English" explanations

**HIGH-severity friction (needs fixing):**
1. **No "Why Web4?" page** — the site explains WHAT but not WHY I should care
2. **Jargon avalanche on How It Works** — LCT, MRH, EP, T3, CI all thrown at once with no inline definitions
3. **Glossary not discoverable** — needs link in header/footer, or inline tooltips

**Key insight:** The site teaches Web4 concepts effectively *once you're engaged*, but doesn't sell you on *why to engage*. I left understanding the mechanics but not feeling motivated to adopt them.

### Priority fixes suggested:
1. Create a "Why Web4?" page explaining the PROBLEM before the solution
2. Add glossary tooltips on first use of acronyms
3. Clarify positioning: "This is [a simulation/real infrastructure/a research project]"
