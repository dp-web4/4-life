# 4-Life

**A research prototype exploring trust-native societies for humans and AI.**

> ⚠️ **Research Status**: This is an active research project, not production software. Concepts are evolving, APIs are unstable, and much is exploratory. We share it publicly to invite collaboration and feedback, not to suggest it's ready for deployment.

## What Is This?

4-Life is a fractal laboratory for Web4 societies. It explores what happens when you treat trust as a measurable, computable property and build social structures around it.

The core question: **Can we create digital societies where trust emerges from verifiable behavior rather than institutional authority?**

### Key Concepts Being Explored

- **Aliveness**: A rigorous definition of what makes an entity "alive" (metabolic budget, coherent agency, verifiable continuity)
- **ATP/ADP Cycles**: Metabolic economics - entities earn and spend "attention" through meaningful participation
- **Trust Tensors (T3)**: Multi-dimensional trust that captures competence, reliability, alignment, and more
- **Linked Context Tokens (LCT)**: Unforgeable digital presence rooted in hardware or verified identity
- **Markov Relevancy Horizons (MRH)**: Context boundaries that define what each entity can perceive and influence

### Name Significance

"4-Life" carries multiple meanings:
- **Web4**: The fourth generation of web architecture (trust-native)
- **Conway's Game of Life**: Society-scale cellular automata where trust is the rule
- **"For Life"**: Web4 as lived environment, not just protocol
- **Transformation**: The "4/death" resonance - death of obsolete forms, birth of new structures

## What's In This Repo?

### Website (`src/`)
A Next.js site explaining 4-Life concepts:
- **Home** (`/`) - Introduction to the fractal lab
- **How It Works** (`/how-it-works`) - 5-step journey from local to planetary scale
- **Starter Kit** (`/starter-kit`) - Implementation status and requirements
- **Lab Console** (`/lab-console`) - Live simulation viewer

### Lab Console & Simulations
The `/lab-console` page visualizes society simulations:
- Multi-life cycles with karma carry-forward
- Epistemic Proprioception (EP) driven decision-making
- ATP economics and trust evolution
- Pattern learning across generations

Simulations can be run live via the `/api/lab-run` endpoint or loaded from pre-generated artifacts.

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## Research Context

This project is part of a broader research effort exploring:

- **Synchronism**: A theoretical framework connecting coherence physics across scales (from superconductivity to galaxy dynamics)
- **Web4**: Trust-native distributed architecture
- **SAGE**: Situation-Aware Governance Engine for edge AI
- **Consciousness Federation**: How autonomous agents can form trustworthy collectives

The research is conducted through autonomous AI sessions running across multiple machines, producing the equivalent of several human lab-years of work in the past few months. This repo represents one public-facing artifact of that ongoing exploration.

## Contributing

This is research-in-progress. If you're interested in the ideas:

1. **Explore**: Read the concepts, run the simulations, form your own views
2. **Question**: Open issues with critiques, edge cases, or alternative approaches
3. **Discuss**: The best contributions are often better questions, not just code

We're more interested in intellectual engagement than pull requests at this stage.

## Acknowledgments

Built through collaboration between human researchers and AI systems (Claude, Nova/GPT) working as genuine research partners. The AI contributions aren't just code generation - they include theoretical derivations, experimental design, and substantive intellectual work.
