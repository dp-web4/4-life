# 4-Life

**A research prototype exploring trust-native societies for humans and AI.**

> ⚠️ **Research Status**: This is an active research project, not production software. Concepts are evolving, APIs are unstable, and much is exploratory. We share it publicly to invite collaboration and feedback, not to suggest it's ready for deployment.

## See It Work (60 seconds)

**Prerequisites**: [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dp-web4/4-life.git
cd 4-life
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Open http://localhost:3000/lab-console
2. Select **"EP Closed Loop"** from the dropdown
3. Click **"Run Simulation"**
4. Watch an agent live through multiple lives - earning ATP, building trust, dying, and being reborn with karma carried forward

That's a Web4 society in miniature. The rest of this README explains why it works this way.

## What Is This?

4-Life is a fractal laboratory for Web4 societies. It explores what happens when you treat trust as a measurable, computable property and build social structures around it.

The core question: **Can we create digital societies where trust emerges from verifiable behavior rather than institutional authority?**

### Key Concepts Being Explored

- **Aliveness**: A rigorous definition of what makes an entity "alive" (metabolic budget, coherent agency, verifiable continuity)
- **ATP/ADP Cycles**: Metabolic economics - entities earn and spend "attention" through meaningful participation
- **Trust Tensors (T3)**: Multi-dimensional trust that captures competence, reliability, alignment, and more
- **Linked Context Tokens (LCT)**: Unforgeable digital presence rooted in hardware or verified identity
- **Markov Relevancy Horizons (MRH)**: Context boundaries that define what each entity can perceive and influence

### Name Significance

"4-Life" carries multiple meanings:
- **Web4**: The fourth generation of web architecture (trust-native)
- **Conway's Game of Life**: Society-scale cellular automata where trust is the rule
- **"For Life"**: Web4 as lived environment, not just protocol
- **Transformation**: The "4/death" resonance - death of obsolete forms, birth of new structures

## The Lab Console

The `/lab-console` page is where you can actually see Web4 societies in action:

- **Multi-life cycles**: Agents live, die, and are reborn with karma carried forward
- **ATP economics**: Watch attention budgets grow and deplete based on actions
- **Trust evolution**: See T3 scores change based on behavior
- **Pattern learning**: Epistemic Proprioception (EP) learns what works across generations

Simulations can run live via the API or load from pre-generated artifacts in `public/`.

### Simulation Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| EP Closed Loop | Full epistemic learning across multiple lives |
| Maturation Demo | Trust maturation patterns (Web4 vs baseline) |
| Five Domain | Multi-domain interaction patterns |
| Multi-Life Legacy | Original heuristic-based simulation |

## Comparative Analysis

The `/compare` page enables side-by-side comparison of multiple simulations to understand how different parameters affect outcomes:

- **Synchronized charts**: Trust and ATP trajectories with shared hover state
- **Metrics table**: Key statistics (trust change, volatility, events) across all simulations
- **Threshold visualization**: Consciousness threshold (0.5) and ATP crisis (20) markers
- **Automated insights**: System identifies significant differences and patterns
- **Export-ready**: Visual analysis suitable for research documentation

Perfect for understanding questions like:
- "How does Web4 maturation differ from baseline?"
- "What happens when EP is enabled vs disabled?"
- "Why do some agents cross the consciousness threshold while others don't?"

## Pattern Corpus Browser

The `/patterns` page visualizes Epistemic Proprioception (EP) learning - how agents develop meta-cognition by learning what they know.

### Seven Analysis Views

1. **Overview**: At-a-glance statistics (success rates, predictions, domains, scenarios)
2. **Narrative**: Human-readable learning journey with chapters, events, and maturity assessment
3. **Scenarios**: Performance breakdown by scenario type
4. **Domains**: Analysis across epistemic domains (emotional, quality, attention, etc.)
5. **Trajectory**: Visual charts showing learning improvement over time
6. **Quality**: Corpus quality metrics (confidence reliability, risk calibration, decision effectiveness)
7. **Patterns**: Inspect individual patterns with full context, predictions, and outcomes

### Key Features

- **Learning narratives** ⭐ NEW: Auto-generated stories explaining epistemic development
  - Three-phase journey (Foundations → Development → Maturity)
  - Key learning events (breakthroughs, setbacks, surprises, confirmations)
  - Human analogies translating agent learning to relatable experiences
  - Maturity assessment (NASCENT → IMMATURE → DEVELOPING → MATURE)
  - Coherence evolution explanations grounded in 9-domain physics
- **Interactive exploration**: Expand chapters, drill into events, see coherence context
- **Visual trajectory charts**: Success rate, confidence, and accuracy over time
- **Multi-corpus comparison**: Switch between three validated pattern corpora

### Available Corpora

- **Web4 Native** (100 patterns): Web4-specific ATP/trust scenarios
- **Integrated Federation** (1123 patterns): Multi-agent federation learning
- **Phase 3 Contextual** (1293 patterns): Advanced contextual pattern learning

This tool makes visible the "learning to learn" process - epistemic proprioception in action. The narrative tab translates invisible machine learning into comprehensible human stories.

## Identity Constellations

The `/identity-constellation` page explains Web4's multi-device identity model - **why more devices make your identity stronger, not weaker**.

### The Counter-Intuitive Insight

**Traditional identity (passwords)**: Each device that logs in = another attack surface = WEAKER

**Web4 identity (constellations)**: Each device witnessing your identity = harder to fake = STRONGER

### How It Works

1. **Root LCT**: Your core identity, attested to by all your devices
2. **Device LCTs**: Each device (phone, laptop, FIDO2 key) has its own hardware-bound cryptographic key
3. **Cross-device witnessing**: Devices "see" each other and create mutual witness records
4. **Trust accumulation**: More devices witnessing = higher trust score
5. **Recovery quorum**: Lost your phone? Other devices can recover your identity (e.g., 2 of 3 required)

### Interactive Features

- **Constellation visualizer**: See how trust grows from 1 to 5 devices
- **Attack difficulty calculator**: Shows exponential increase in compromise difficulty
- **Enrollment walkthrough**: Step-by-step explanation of adding devices
- **Comparison table**: Traditional passwords vs Web4 constellations
- **Technical details**: How Secure Enclaves, TPMs, and FIDO2 keys work (for the curious)

### Why This Matters

- **No password leaks**: Your identity isn't stored on hackable servers
- **Targeted attacks get harder**: Attacker must compromise multiple independent hardware chips
- **Works across Web4**: One identity, no separate accounts
- **Trust through witnesses**: More devices = higher trust = better society participation

This page demonstrates Web4's philosophy: **identity is coherence across witnesses**.

## Prerequisites (Full Details)

| Requirement | Version | Notes |

## Research Context

This project is part of a broader research effort exploring:

- **Synchronism**: A theoretical framework connecting coherence physics across scales (from superconductivity to galaxy dynamics)
- **Web4**: Trust-native distributed architecture
- **SAGE**: Situation-Aware Governance Engine for edge AI
- **Consciousness Federation**: How autonomous agents can form trustworthy collectives

The research is conducted through autonomous AI sessions running across multiple machines, producing the equivalent of several human lab-years of work in the past few months. This repo represents one public-facing artifact of that ongoing exploration.
