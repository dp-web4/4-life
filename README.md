# 4-Life Website

Public-facing website for the 4-Life Web4 society simulation game/lab.

## Overview

**4-Life** is a fractal laboratory for Web4 societies - both human and AI. It's where the transformation symbolism of "4" (death → rebirth) meets the technical reality of distributed trust-native architecture.

### Name Significance

"4-Life" carries multiple layers of meaning:
- **Web4 linkage**: Direct connection to Web4 as the fourth layer/generation
- **Conway's Game of Life**: Higher-order cellular automaton (societies vs cells)
- **Phonetic**: "for life" = Web4 as lived environment, not just protocol
- **Transformation**: Embraces 4/death cultural resonance as feature - death of obsolete forms, birth of new structures

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14.1.0 (React 18, TypeScript)
- **Styling**: CSS Modules with custom design system
- **Deployment**: TBD (Vercel recommended)

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Site Structure

- **Home** (`/`) - Hero introducing 4-Life as fractal lab for societies
- **How It Works** (`/how-it-works`) - 5-step journey from local society to planet-scale network
- **Starter Kit** (`/starter-kit`) - Requirements and current implementation status

## Content Philosophy

The site explains Web4 societies through accessible language while preserving technical accuracy:

1. **Hardware-bound societies**: Root LCT on your machine
2. **MRH & LCT**: Verifiable context graphs
3. **Fractal federation**: Peer/citizen/task-based society links
4. **Hub societies**: Witnesses for capability broadcasts
5. **Game to standard**: Stress-testing mechanics before standardization

## Connection to Web4 Game Engine

The game engine lives in `web4/game` directory of the main ai-agents repository. This website is the public-facing portal for users to discover and start their own societies.

## Status

- ✅ Initial structure and content (Cascade/GPT-5.1)
- ✅ Responsive layout with custom CSS
- 🚧 Starter kit download flow (pending)
- 🚧 Hub society integration (pending)
- 🚧 Public deployment (pending)
