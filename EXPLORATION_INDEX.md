## Key Findings (TL;DR)

### The Good
- ✅ 24 pages implemented, all linked correctly
- ✅ Threat model is honest about limitations
- ✅ "Show don't tell" works on core pages

## Exploration Methodology

This exploration used:
- Direct file inspection of all 24 page implementations
- Cross-reference checking (README links vs actual pages)
- Content analysis (what pages promise vs what they deliver)
- Gap identification (threat model claims vs demonstrations)
- Pedagogical assessment (learning journey structure)
- Scoring rubric (9-10 dimensions)

**Coverage**: Medium thoroughness (file-level analysis, not code-level)
