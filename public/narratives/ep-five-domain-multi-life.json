  "title": "Alice: Five Domains of Knowing — Emotional, Quality, Attention, Grounding, Authorization",
  "summary": "This five-domain simulation assesses an agent across all EP dimensions: emotional regulation, quality judgment, attention management, grounding verification, and authorization awareness. This simulation follows Alice through 3 lives spanning 60 ticks. Starting with trust of 0.60 and ending at 0.55, the agent maintained stable behavior, experiencing 6 major events along the way. Key themes include: Karma and Consequences, Equilibrium and Stability. This narrative illustrates core Web4 principles: trust is earned through consistent behavior, actions have lasting consequences (karma), and agents can learn and improve across multiple lives through epistemic proprioception.",
