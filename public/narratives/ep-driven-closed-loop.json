  "title": "Bob: 3 Lives of Karma and Consequences",
  "summary": "This simulation follows Bob through 3 lives spanning 31 ticks. Starting with trust of 0.50 and ending at 0.53, the agent maintained stable behavior, experiencing 23 major events along the way. Key themes include: Karma and Consequences, Equilibrium and Stability. This narrative illustrates core Web4 principles: trust is earned through consistent behavior, actions have lasting consequences (karma), and agents can learn and improve across multiple lives through epistemic proprioception.",
