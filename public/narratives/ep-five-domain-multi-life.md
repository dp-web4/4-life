## Summary

This five-domain simulation assesses an agent across all EP dimensions: emotional regulation, quality judgment, attention management, grounding verification, and authorization awareness. This simulation follows Alice through 3 lives spanning 60 ticks. Starting with trust of 0.60 and ending at 0.55, the agent maintained stable behavior, experiencing 6 major events along the way. Key themes include: Karma and Consequences, Equilibrium and Stability. This narrative illustrates core Web4 principles: trust is earned through consistent behavior, actions have lasting consequences (karma), and agents can learn and improve across multiple lives through epistemic proprioception.

## Themes

- **Karma and Consequences**
- **Equilibrium and Stability**
- **Multi-Domain Assessment**

## Key Insights

- Trust remained stable: 0.60 → 0.55 over 3 lives. The agent found equilibrium quickly.

## Narrative

### Life 1: Development (Trust: 0.60)

**[Life 1, Tick 0]**

A new agent enters the Web4 society. Starting with trust of 0.60 and 100 ATP (attention tokens), they must prove themselves through consistent behavior.

> ⚡ **Why it matters**: First impressions matter. Initial trust sets expectations.

---

**[Life 1, Tick 5]**

Trust stabilizes at 0.60. The agent has found a sustainable pattern of behavior. This plateau suggests they've reached equilibrium between their capabilities and society's expectations.

> ⚡ **Why it matters**: Part of the ongoing trust dynamics.

---

**[Life 1, Tick 20]**

Life ends: natural. Final trust: 0.60, ATP: 32.5. Duration: 20 ticks.

> ⚡ **Why it matters**: Death isn't failure - it's part of the cycle. What matters is the trust you carried forward.


---

### Life 2: Development (Trust: 0.55)

**[Life 2, Tick 20]**

Rebirth with consequences. Their previous life's behavior resulted in starting trust of 0.55, lower than before. In Web4, actions have lasting consequences.

> 📚 **Technical**: Karma mechanism: trust_gain = -0.0500, calculated from coherence index of previous life's behavior pattern.

> ⚡ **Why it matters**: Demonstrates Web4's memory: Your past actions shape your future starting conditions.

---

**[Life 2, Tick 25]**

Trust stabilizes at 0.55. The agent has found a sustainable pattern of behavior. This plateau suggests they've reached equilibrium between their capabilities and society's expectations.

> ⚡ **Why it matters**: Part of the ongoing trust dynamics.

---

**[Life 2, Tick 40]**

Life ends: natural. Final trust: 0.55, ATP: 32.5. Duration: 20 ticks.

> ⚡ **Why it matters**: Death isn't failure - it's part of the cycle. What matters is the trust you carried forward.


---

### Life 3: Development (Trust: 0.55)

**[Life 3, Tick 40]**

Rebirth with consequences. Their previous life's behavior resulted in starting trust of 0.55, unchanged. In Web4, actions have lasting consequences.

> 📚 **Technical**: Karma mechanism: trust_gain = 0.0000, calculated from coherence index of previous life's behavior pattern.

> ⚡ **Why it matters**: Demonstrates Web4's memory: Your past actions shape your future starting conditions.

---

**[Life 3, Tick 45]**

Trust stabilizes at 0.55. The agent has found a sustainable pattern of behavior. This plateau suggests they've reached equilibrium between their capabilities and society's expectations.

> ⚡ **Why it matters**: Part of the ongoing trust dynamics.

---

**[Life 3, Tick 60]**

Life ends: natural. Final trust: 0.55, ATP: 32.5. Duration: 20 ticks.

> ⚡ **Why it matters**: Death isn't failure - it's part of the cycle. What matters is the trust you carried forward.

---

**[Life 3, Tick 60]**

Remarkable consistency: This life's trust trajectory closely matches the previous life. The agent has found a reliable pattern and is executing it with precision. This stability suggests deep learning, not luck.

> ⚡ **Why it matters**: Indicates mastery: The agent has found a reliable strategy and executes it precisely.


#### Commentary

The remarkable consistency across lives suggests the agent has found a stable attractor - a behavioral pattern that works reliably. This isn't mechanical repetition, but rather the demonstration of having learned a generalizable strategy.
