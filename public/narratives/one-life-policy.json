  "title": "Unknown: A Single Life in Web4 — Trust Under Pressure",
  "summary": "This single-life simulation tests how an agent performs within a single lifetime, without the safety net of karma carry-forward or rebirth. This simulation follows Unknown through 1 life spanning 20 ticks. Starting with trust of 0.60 and ending at 0.60, the agent maintained stable behavior, experiencing 2 major events along the way. Key themes include: Equilibrium and Stability. This narrative illustrates core Web4 principles: trust is earned through consistent behavior, actions have lasting consequences (karma), and agents can learn and improve across multiple lives through epistemic proprioception.",
