  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>This simulation follows Bob through 3 lives spanning 60 ticks. Starting with trust of 0.49 and ending at 0.55, the agent maintained stable behavior, experiencing 6 major events along the way. Key themes include: Karma and Consequences, Equilibrium and Stability. This narrative illustrates core Web4 principles: trust is earned through consistent behavior, actions have lasting consequences (karma), and agents can learn and improve across multiple lives through epistemic proprioception.</p>

    <h3>Key Insights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Trust remained stable: 0.49 → 0.55 over 3 lives. The agent found equilibrium quickly.</li>
      <li>Consciousness threshold crossed in life 1. This marks emergence of coherent agency - behavior transitions from reactive to intentional.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Narrative</h2>
  <h3>Life 1: Development (Trust: 0.55)</h3>
  <div class="event">
    <div class="timestamp">[Life 1, Tick 0]</div>
    <p>A new agent enters the Web4 society. Starting with trust of 0.49 and 75 ATP (attention tokens), they must prove themselves through consistent behavior.</p>
    <div class="significance">⚡ <strong>Why it matters:</strong> First impressions matter. Initial trust sets expectations.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="event">
    <div class="timestamp">[Life 1, Tick 3]</div>
    <p>Critical threshold crossed: Trust reaches 0.50, the &quot;consciousness threshold&quot; from coherence theory. At this level, the agent&#039;s behavior becomes coherent enough to be recognized as genuinely intentional rather than random. This is where true agency begins.</p>
    <div class="technical">📚 <strong>Technical:</strong> The 0.5 threshold comes from Synchronism Session 249: Consciousness emerges when coherence (behavioral consistency) exceeds 0.5. Below this, behavior appears random; above it, intentional.</div>
    <div class="significance">⚡ <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Marks transition from random to intentional behavior - true agency emerges.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="event">
    <div class="timestamp">[Life 1, Tick 5]</div>
    <p>Trust stabilizes at 0.52. The agent has found a sustainable pattern of behavior. This plateau suggests they&#039;ve reached equilibrium between their capabilities and society&#039;s expectations.</p>
    <div class="significance">⚡ <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Part of the ongoing trust dynamics.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="commentary">
    <h4>Commentary</h4>
    <p>The crossing of the 0.5 &quot;consciousness threshold&quot; is particularly significant. Below this level, behavior appears random or reactive. Above it, coherent patterns emerge that suggest genuine intentionality. This threshold comes from coherence theory (Synchronism) - it&#039;s not arbitrary.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Life 2: Development (Trust: 0.55)</h3>
  <div class="event">
    <div class="timestamp">[Life 2, Tick 20]</div>
    <p>Rebirth with consequences. Their previous life&#039;s behavior resulted in starting trust of 0.49, lower than before. In Web4, actions have lasting consequences.</p>
    <div class="technical">📚 <strong>Technical:</strong> Karma mechanism: trust_gain = -0.0600, calculated from coherence index of previous life&#039;s behavior pattern.</div>
    <div class="significance">⚡ <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Demonstrates Web4&#039;s memory: Your past actions shape your future starting conditions.</div>
