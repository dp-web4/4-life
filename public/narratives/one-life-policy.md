## Summary

This single-life simulation tests how an agent performs within a single lifetime, without the safety net of karma carry-forward or rebirth. This simulation follows Unknown through 1 life spanning 20 ticks. Starting with trust of 0.60 and ending at 0.60, the agent maintained stable behavior, experiencing 2 major events along the way. Key themes include: Equilibrium and Stability. This narrative illustrates core Web4 principles: trust is earned through consistent behavior, actions have lasting consequences (karma), and agents can learn and improve across multiple lives through epistemic proprioception.

## Themes

- **Equilibrium and Stability**
- **Single Life**
- **No Rebirth**

## Key Insights

- Trust remained stable: 0.60 → 0.60 over 1 lives. The agent found equilibrium quickly.

## Narrative

### Life 1: Development (Trust: 0.60)

**[Life 1, Tick 0]**

A new agent enters the Web4 society. Starting with trust of 0.60 and 100 ATP (attention tokens), they must prove themselves through consistent behavior.

> ⚡ **Why it matters**: First impressions matter. Initial trust sets expectations.

---

**[Life 1, Tick 5]**

Trust stabilizes at 0.60. The agent has found a sustainable pattern of behavior. This plateau suggests they've reached equilibrium between their capabilities and society's expectations.

> ⚡ **Why it matters**: Part of the ongoing trust dynamics.

---

**[Life 1, Tick 20]**

Life ends: natural. Final trust: 0.60, ATP: 100. Duration: 20 ticks.

> ⚡ **Why it matters**: Death isn't failure - it's part of the cycle. What matters is the trust you carried forward.
