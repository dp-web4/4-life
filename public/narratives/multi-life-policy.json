  "title": "Bob: Multi-Life Policy Framework — Trust Across Reincarnations",
  "summary": "This multi-life simulation tests the policy integration framework, showing how agent decisions carry consequences across life cycles through karma mechanics. This simulation follows Bob through 3 lives spanning 32 ticks. Starting with trust of 0.49 and ending at 0.53, the agent maintained stable behavior, experiencing 15 major events along the way. Key themes include: Karma and Consequences, Equilibrium and Stability. This narrative illustrates core Web4 principles: trust is earned through consistent behavior, actions have lasting consequences (karma), and agents can learn and improve across multiple lives through epistemic proprioception.",
