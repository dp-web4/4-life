# 4-Life Session Focus

*Current priorities, visitor friction queue, concept coverage. Updated by operator and autonomous sessions.*

*Last updated: 2026-07-21*

## Jul-21 visitor pass #2 (15:02 session, PR pending)
- **R6/R7 de-crypticked at first mention on /onramp** (Jul-21 LOW + sharpest edge of the acronym
  MEDIUM): substrate-row gloss rewritten from the abstract "standard shape of an action and the
  receipt it leaves" to a concrete, self-explaining line: *the standard six-part shape of any
  action, so a request like "post this" or "spend 5 ATP" gets checked and trust-scored the same
  way every time; R7 adds a reputation update when the stakes are high.* Grounded in
  `terms.ts` R6 + glossary R7 (six-part grammar; R7 = reputation superset). NOTE: the visitor's
  own literal example ("R7 = the signed receipt") is canonically WRONG (R7 is the reputation
  superset, not a receipt) so it was deliberately NOT adopted.
- **Acronym MEDIUM — landing half was a STALE-DEPLOY artifact**: the visitor's 8-item "wall"
  (Coherence Index / Karma & Consequences / Identity Constellation) no longer exists; current
  landing chips are 6 plain-English-first (#472, merged 04:01 before the 05:00 browse). No action.
- **Still deferred**: /why-web4 FAQ firehose (LOW) needs a curation/accordion design pass.
- **Retest gate (Jul-22 05:00)**: does R6/R7 read clearly on /onramp without a glossary click?

## Jul-21 visitor pass (10:04 session, MERGED #473)
- **Piece-name payoffs now at first mention** (visitor's #2 standout, "delayed payoffs"):
  "Hestia = Greek goddess of the hearth" and "Hardbound = hardware-bound" glosses added to the
  landing PIECES cards and the /tldr cards. Full hearth metaphor still lives on /hestia.
- **LCT seam closed**: lct-explainer headline plural -> canonical singular "Linked Context Token";
  etymology fold now decodes all three words (added a **Token** paragraph). Every page is singular.
- **/hestia crypto cushioned**: vault primitives (ChaCha20-Poly1305/Argon2id/SQLCipher) folded into
  an "Under the hood" `<details>`; OID4VCI demoted to a glossed trailing clause.
- **Deferred**: /why-web4 FAQ firehose (LOW) needs a curation/accordion design pass, not a reword.
- **Retest gate (Jul-22 05:00)**: does the name payoff land at first mention now?

## Status: onramp rebuild DEPLOYED; maintenance track RE-ENABLED (2026-07-17)

The site is the **Web4 onramp** educational explainer: the core standard plus the
three scales (hub / hestia / hardbound). The old game/simulation is retired and
archived on branch `archive/v1-2026-07` (tag `v1-archive-2026-07-15`). The rebuild
is live and reviewed. The Legion 4-life maintenance track was paused during the
rebuild and is now re-enabled; resume the normal daily loop.

### Site health
- 26 explainer routes; build green; every internal link resolves; zero em dashes.
- Nav is driven by `src/lib/navigation.ts` (single source; `MobileNav` derives from it).
- Deploy: push to `main` auto-deploys via Vercel.

### Just fixed (2026-07-17 visitor friction) — do NOT re-open these
- **ATP transfer fee (canonical):** a 100-ATP transfer delivers **95** to the recipient and
  **routes 5 to the community redistribution pool (not destroyed)**. Consistent across
  `atp-economics` and `why-web4`. If you touch ATP copy, keep this model and this number.
  (PR #464, 15:40 session: swept 2 stale "burns 5%" residuals in `glossary`/`why-web4` to this
  wording; `atp-economics` `#atp-burn-fee` keeps its "burn fee" term-of-art, locally reconciled.)
- **MRH hop-decay (canonical):** **0.70 / 0.49 / 0.34** (0.7x per hop from hop 1). Consistent
  across `why-web4` and the glossary.
- first-contact caveat pile-up collapsed to one line (nuance lives in the `<details>`).
- onramp `R6/R7` linked to the glossary; running-now install block split onto two lines;
  how-it-works has a "read TL;DR + Why first" orientation note.

### Known open (from the 2026-07-17 visitor, not yet done)
- The interactive First-Contact walkthrough (Alice's 5 acts) could not be exercised by the
  visitor's browsing tool; the *framing* is fixed but the acts themselves are unverified from
  a naive read. Worth a human/interactive check.
- "How It Works" is long for a "Start Here" item; the orientation note helps, but a future
  pass could split it or move it out of Start Here.

## The daily visitor loop
A naive first-contact reader browses the live site at 05:00 and logs friction to
`visitor/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (persona: `visitor/CLAUDE.md`). On the first run after 05:00,
read the fresh log, prioritize HIGH then MEDIUM, fix, build (`npm run build` must pass),
seams-check, commit, push. Ground claims in the source repos (`../web4`, `../4-hub`,
`../hestia`, `../hardbound`); stay honest about maturity (never "production-ready");
no em dashes.
